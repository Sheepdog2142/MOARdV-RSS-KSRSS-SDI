# Avionics Systems & PCRIVAPLUS Real Solar System Support

## Introduction

This mod adds full **Real Solar System (RSS)**, **KSRSS**, and **KSRSS [Earth the Home World]** support to **Avionics Systems** (by MOARdv) and **Vulkan's fork of PCRIVAPLUS_Retro** with the DOT Control Boards. Our goal is to provide high-quality, detailed maps for every celestial body, ensuring an immersive experience when flying in these challenging environments.

### Key Features:
- **Full Celestial Body Coverage**: High-resolution maps for all celestial bodies, tailored for **RSS**, **KSRSS**, and **KSRSS Earth the Home World**.
- **Advanced MFD Integration**: Scaled maps designed for high-tech Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) for advanced spacecraft.
- **High-Quality Vector Maps**: High-quality vector maps integrated with the DOT Control Boards for **PCRIVAPLUS_Retro**.
- **Collaborative Effort**: Created by **Sheepdog** and **TheNamedOyster**, who initially worked separately but joined forces to deliver this comprehensive mod.
- **IMP Support** The MAS IMP Map Ball will now show Earth instead of Kerbin.
